![Alt text](./Images/sktLogo.png)<br/>
<br/>
SKT stands for "Skinny Tool" :)<br/>
Some things are inspired by EVA 2, thanks guys.<br/>
This toolhead is designed to be as light as possible with a "TAP" like probe. It will not be compatible with all extruders and all hotends or even with all types of toolboards due to its design and specificity.<br/>
STK toolhead allow the installation of SHT42/EBB42 toolboards only.><br/>
If you want to run fast, just try it.<br/><br/>
<B>Whit this mod you will able to use all the build plate on X axis, but you will lose about 8mm on Y axis</B><br/>
