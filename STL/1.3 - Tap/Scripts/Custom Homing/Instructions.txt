1) Include the "SKT-Homing.cfg" file in the printer.cfg or copy its contents into your macro file if you have one.

2) In the printer.cfg file set [safe_z_home] as follows (or add it if not present):

[safe_z_home]
home_xy_position:117.5,117.5  #set your right coordinates of the center
speed:150				#set your preferred homing speed
z_hop:0				#Keep this value = 0



3) In the printer.cfg file add as follows:

[force_move]
enable_force_move: True		#Keep this value = True


4) In your macro of "END_PRINT" (it could be called something else) verify that there is "G28 X Y", if so add after the head has moved away from the bed

5) In your "PAUSE" macro set the parking coordinates as follows:

  {% set x_park = printer.toolhead.axis_maximum.x|float - 80.0  %}
  {% set y_park = printer.toolhead.axis_maximum.y|float - 40.0 %}
